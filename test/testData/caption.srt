00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,610
20:19 has been an amazing year and I

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,200
just want to start by saying thank you

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,720
to everybody if we rewind one year fire

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,700
ship IO wasn't even a thing yet around

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,590
that time I was worried that rebranding

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,269
the channel would end my YouTube career

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,860
but I'm very thankful that that hasn't

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,299
been the case and I get to continue

9
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,760
doing my dream job in 2020 I'm extremely

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,619
grateful for the support and wanted to

11
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,029
take a few minutes to give you an idea

12
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,430
of my plans going into next year but

13
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,960
first we've got a t-shirt to giveaway

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,150
Congrats to waltz of kymaro you're the

15
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,189
winner from the JavaScript 2020 video

16
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,170
send me a private message on slack with

17
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,420
your size and shipping details but don't

18
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,710
feel bad if you missed out because at

19
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,210
the end of this video I'll announce a

20
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,710
second t-shirt winner so you have

21
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,230
another chance first things first I'm

22
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,300
taking a much-needed vacation throughout

23
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,950
most of January I'll be traveling to

24
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,020
Australia and New Zealand but the good

25
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,579
news is I'm not just going to disappear

26
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,100
I'll still be around on slack and I have

27
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,140
a bunch of 100 seconds of code videos

28
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,059
already pre produced you may have seen a

29
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,530
couple of these earlier in the week and

30
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,180
the response has been very positive so

31
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,010
far the YouTube algorithm doesn't really

32
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,899
like short videos like this but I do

33
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,399
think they will add a lot of value to

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,870
the channel overall because they pack a

35
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,820
ton of information into a very small

36
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,159
package now that being said I have no

37
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,900
plans to change the existing format

38
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,880
after I get back you'll continue to see

39
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,650
plenty of longer format content about

40
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,080
firebase flutter angular and so on

41
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,790
if you're a pro member you can expect to

42
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,830
see new courses in 2020 along with

43
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,750
revisions to existing courses in

44
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,939
addition I plan to add more advanced

45
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,549
modules to individual courses so instead

46
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:27,960
of a course that you take from start to

47
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,610
finish you take it to a certain point

48
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,470
and then you can branch off to whatever

49
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,119
advanced feature you're interested in

50
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,890
building with Striped payments for

51
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,420
example you would start with a basic

52
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,640
intro into handling payments then you

53
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,200
could branch off to strong customer

54
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,750
authentication or stripe connect or some

55
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,820
other advanced concept this would allow

56
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,860
me to roll out content more quickly in a

57
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,960
modular format and it'll make the

58
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,369
content easier for you to consume

59
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:51,360
because you won't have to go through

60
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,610
things that you don't care about now a

61
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,259
few months ago I started working on a

62
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,570
project called spelt fire it's just a

63
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,040
simple open source library that

64
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,840
integrates firebase into some small

65
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,549
components but the main reason I built

66
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,140
it in the first place is because I want

67
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,909
to roll out several advanced UI

68
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,340
components for firebase users that can

69
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,170
be dropped into any framework like

70
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,090
imagine a file uploader widget that can

71
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,160
be dropped into your friend

72
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,080
that automatically integrates with your

73
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,330
back-end infrastructure or an email pass

74
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,010
trought education form that integrates

75
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,750
with any design system now that's

76
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,490
obviously a very big project that takes

77
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,200
a lot of work to do right so I don't

78
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,150
want to rush anything out the door the

79
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,560
last thing I want to talk about is the

80
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,930
migration of angular firebase into fire

81
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,470
ship IO

82
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,940
all of the full courses have been

83
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,590
migrated over already but there's still

84
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,630
a lot of individual lessons on angular

85
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,820
firebase that need to be migrated that

86
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,520
process will be 100% complete by January

87
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,620
1st and the angular firebase site will

88
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,820
redirect a fire ship

89
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,410
none of that content is going away it's

90
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,150
just being fully integrated under one

91
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,650
roof and you can access it with the

92
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,870
angular tag on fire ship at any time I

93
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,730
think that's all the updates I have

94
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,620
right now thanks again for all of these

95
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,480
supports and I will see you again in

96
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,960
2020 oh wait I almost forgot we still

97
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,130
have another t-shirt to give away

98
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,440
Congrats Locke Sean Pereira you are the

99
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,970
second t-shirt winner of the video

100
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,370
thanks again everybody I will talk to

101
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,610
you soon
