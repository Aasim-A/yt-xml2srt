    <text start="6.72" dur="3.87">ship IO wasn&amp;#39;t even a thing yet around</text>
    <text start="8.7" dur="3.569">that time I was worried that rebranding</text>
    <text start="10.59" dur="3.27">the channel would end my YouTube career</text>
    <text start="12.269" dur="3.03">but I&amp;#39;m very thankful that that hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
    <text start="13.86" dur="3.9">been the case and I get to continue</text>
    <text start="15.299" dur="4.32">doing my dream job in 2020 I&amp;#39;m extremely</text>
    <text start="17.76" dur="3.269">grateful for the support and wanted to</text>
    <text start="19.619" dur="3.811">take a few minutes to give you an idea</text>
    <text start="21.029" dur="3.931">of my plans going into next year but</text>
    <text start="23.43" dur="3.72">first we&amp;#39;ve got a t-shirt to giveaway</text>
    <text start="24.96" dur="4.229">Congrats to waltz of kymaro you&amp;#39;re the</text>
    <text start="27.15" dur="4.02">winner from the JavaScript 2020 video</text>

    <text start="31.17" dur="3.54">your size and shipping details but don&amp;#39;t</text>

    <text start="36.21" dur="4.02">second t-shirt winner so you have</text>
    <text start="37.71" dur="4.59">another chance first things first I&amp;#39;m</text>
    <text start="40.23" dur="3.72">taking a much-needed vacation throughout</text>
    <text start="42.3" dur="3.72">most of January I&amp;#39;ll be traveling to</text>
    <text start="43.95" dur="3.629">Australia and New Zealand but the good</text>
    <text start="46.02" dur="4.08">news is I&amp;#39;m not just going to disappear</text>
    <text start="47.579" dur="4.561">I&amp;#39;ll still be around on slack and I have</text>
    <text start="50.1" dur="3.959">a bunch of 100 seconds of code videos</text>
    <text start="52.14" dur="3.39">already pre produced you may have seen a</text>
    <text start="54.059" dur="3.121">couple of these earlier in the week and</text>
    <text start="55.53" dur="3.48">the response has been very positive so</text>
    <text start="57.18" dur="3.719">far the YouTube algorithm doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
    <text start="59.01" dur="3.389">like short videos like this but I do</text>
    <text start="60.899" dur="2.971">think they will add a lot of value to</text>
    <text start="62.399" dur="3.421">the channel overall because they pack a</text>
    <text start="63.87" dur="4.289">ton of information into a very small</text>
    <text start="65.82" dur="4.08">package now that being said I have no</text>
    <text start="68.159" dur="3.721">plans to change the existing format</text>
    <text start="69.9" dur="3.75">after I get back you&amp;#39;ll continue to see</text>
    <text start="71.88" dur="4.2">plenty of longer format content about</text>
    <text start="73.65" dur="4.14">firebase flutter angular and so on</text>
    <text start="76.08" dur="3.75">if you&amp;#39;re a pro member you can expect to</text>
    <text start="77.79" dur="3.96">see new courses in 2020 along with</text>
    <text start="79.83" dur="4.109">revisions to existing courses in</text>
    <text start="81.75" dur="4.799">addition I plan to add more advanced</text>
    <text start="83.939" dur="4.021">modules to individual courses so instead</text>
    <text start="86.549" dur="3.061">of a course that you take from start to</text>
    <text start="87.96" dur="3.51">finish you take it to a certain point</text>
    <text start="89.61" dur="3.509">and then you can branch off to whatever</text>
    <text start="91.47" dur="3.42">advanced feature you&amp;#39;re interested in</text>
    <text start="93.119" dur="3.301">building with Striped payments for</text>
    <text start="94.89" dur="3.75">example you would start with a basic</text>
    <text start="96.42" dur="3.78">intro into handling payments then you</text>
    <text start="98.64" dur="4.11">could branch off to strong customer</text>
    <text start="100.2" dur="4.62">authentication or stripe connect or some</text>
    <text start="102.75" dur="4.11">other advanced concept this would allow</text>
    <text start="104.82" dur="4.14">me to roll out content more quickly in a</text>
    <text start="106.86" dur="3.509">modular format and it&amp;#39;ll make the</text>
    <text start="108.96" dur="2.4">content easier for you to consume</text>
    <text start="110.369" dur="3.241">because you won&amp;#39;t have to go through</text>
    <text start="111.36" dur="3.899">things that you don&amp;#39;t care about now a</text>
    <text start="113.61" dur="3.96">few months ago I started working on a</text>
    <text start="115.259" dur="3.781">project called spelt fire it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
    <text start="117.57" dur="3.27">simple open source library that</text>
    <text start="119.04" dur="3.509">integrates firebase into some small</text>
    <text start="120.84" dur="3.3">components but the main reason I built</text>
    <text start="122.549" dur="3.36">it in the first place is because I want</text>
    <text start="124.14" dur="4.2">to roll out several advanced UI</text>
    <text start="125.909" dur="4.261">components for firebase users that can</text>
    <text start="128.34" dur="3.75">be dropped into any framework like</text>
    <text start="130.17" dur="2.99">imagine a file uploader widget that can</text>
    <text start="132.09" dur="2.99">be dropped into your friend</text>
    <text start="133.16" dur="4.17">that automatically integrates with your</text>
    <text start="135.08" dur="3.93">back-end infrastructure or an email pass</text>
    <text start="137.33" dur="3.42">trought education form that integrates</text>
    <text start="139.01" dur="3.48">with any design system now that&amp;#39;s</text>
    <text start="140.75" dur="3.45">obviously a very big project that takes</text>
    <text start="142.49" dur="3.66">a lot of work to do right so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
    <text start="144.2" dur="3.36">want to rush anything out the door the</text>
    <text start="146.15" dur="3.78">last thing I want to talk about is the</text>
    <text start="147.56" dur="2.91">migration of angular firebase into fire</text>
    <text start="149.93" dur="2.01">ship IO</text>
    <text start="150.47" dur="3.12">all of the full courses have been</text>
    <text start="151.94" dur="3.69">migrated over already but there&amp;#39;s still</text>
    <text start="153.59" dur="4.23">a lot of individual lessons on angular</text>
    <text start="155.63" dur="4.89">firebase that need to be migrated that</text>
    <text start="157.82" dur="4.8">process will be 100% complete by January</text>
    <text start="160.52" dur="3.3">1st and the angular firebase site will</text>
    <text start="162.62" dur="2.79">redirect a fire ship</text>
    <text start="163.82" dur="3.33">none of that content is going away it&amp;#39;s</text>
    <text start="165.41" dur="3.24">just being fully integrated under one</text>
    <text start="167.15" dur="3.72">roof and you can access it with the</text>
    <text start="168.65" dur="4.08">angular tag on fire ship at any time I</text>
    <text start="170.87" dur="3.75">think that&amp;#39;s all the updates I have</text>
